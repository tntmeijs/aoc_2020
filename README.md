# Avent of Code 2020
This repository contains my code submissions for the Advent of Code 2020.
I've used this event to teach myself Rust.

The code is probably horrible / ugly as this is literally the first time I've ever used Rust.

For the record, I'm not going for optimal solutions. I'm just trying to stop the Rust compiler from shouting at me...
