# Avent of Code 2020
The [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) is a yearly competition in which programmers from all over the world compete to solve the most puzzles the quickest.

I decided to take part in the [2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020) competition. But instead of trying to reach the top of the (private) leaderboard, I used this opportunity to play around with a languages I had never used before: [Rust](https://rustlang.org).

<sub>For the record, I'm not going for optimal or clean solutions. I'm just trying to stop the Rust compiler from shouting at me...</sub>

# About this project
This repository contains my code submissions for the Advent of Code 2020. I structured the project to be clear and easy to maintain. Each puzzle lives in its own library and does not rely on the other puzzles to function.

# Running the puzzles
Execute `cargo run` in the root project directory
